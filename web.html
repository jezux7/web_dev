        <h1>Why Clash Royale is not just a game</h1>

        <P><b>Clash Royale isn't just a game. You might wonder why, and here I'll tell you the reasons why Clash Royale isn't a game, it's a way of life.</b>
        <ol>
            <h2>Reason #1</h2>
         <P>The first thing that sets Clash apart from a simple game, I would say, is the pressure. You are ONE trophy away from reaching the next arena after weeks or months of trying to get close, and then you go back to the beginning. This is the right one, and you get pumped up and start... Once you see the enemy, 
            this isn't a physical fight, it's a mental battle that takes seconds. You see the cards you started with and you also see the elixir. While you wait to reach 9 elixir, you analyze your enemy. 
            Who will play the first card, you or them? The game begins. You play a card to cycle your card forward and strike. You're happy, but the enemy plays a sparky. You analyze what else they could have while your card advances and when you're going to defend... Boom, 
            an electric dragon and a P.E.K.K.A. You wonder where they got so much elixir, but the only important thing is to defend... That's how all the games are, mental battles that are created in seconds of pure analysis of the enemy's slightest movement.

        <h3> Reason #2</h3>

        <p>Resource management: at first, you'll think, “Wow, I'm rich, I'm going to buy everything I want.” You're wrong. The most important thing is to save for the future and max out your cards,
             because later, when you're in the high arenas and you need a good deck, you won't be able to upgrade the cards you need, and you'll be stuck in that arena for a very long time.

        <h4>Reason 3:</h4>
        <p>Strategy: as you advance area by area, you learn that you must learn which card to play against another card, as well as how to manage your elixir, because if you run out of elixir, you cannot play cards and you are left without defense or attack.</p>

        <h5>Reason 4:</h5>
        <p>Emotes: Emotes are a way to express yourself to your opponent and are a great source of memes such as “hahaha.” They also add accessibility for the user and extend the game lifespan.<p>

        <h6>Reason 5:</h6>
        <p><b>Towers: You can also customize your towers and add personality to them so they're not so basic, which I think is a great idea.</p><b>
