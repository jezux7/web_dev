            <li>Num 1: Empanadas are very good because there is a lot of variety: chicken, cheese, cheese with potatoes, shredded beef, ground beef, and many others. You can always eat them for breakfast or dinner, and since there is so much variety, you never get bored.</li>

            <li>Num 2: We make them because they are delicious, simple but tasty, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Plus, it's not common to eat more than 8, so they're the perfect snack for the day.</li>

            <li>Num 3: Patacones are mashed and fried plantains that are filled with things like cheese, ham, meat, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and other things if you want. If you make them yourself, you can make them however you like.</li>
